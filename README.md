Colour_Detection
Semestral project done for Polytech Angers which purpose is to explore Python OpenCV library. 
Using the simple methods I explored the colour detection in OpenCV.
There are five detectable colours: red, green, blue, yellow, violet.
Program is configured to work on built in laptop camera.
